**This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum's JavaScript Course (Project: Library).**

The goal of this project is to practice JS, more specifically, to explore the object-oriented programming capabilities of the language. To achieve this, I will create a booklibrary where users can input books that they are interested in. They will have the opportunity to input the year the book was written, the author of the book, and the title of the book.

*Books are a great example of real-life things that can be represented in code with the use of objects.*

I may also play around with CSS tailwind or similar libraries to achieve a visually (somewhat) satisfactory result.

Today i would've built it with react
